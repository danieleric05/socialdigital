                            royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide right and license: (i) to copy,

                            3. TERM AND TERMINATION
                            3.1 The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and continue until
                            expiration or termination of all Order Form’s and/or SOW’s (the “Term”). Each Order Form and
                            SOW will have its own term as stated in such document.

                            3.2 Either party may terminate this Agreement and all Order Forms and SOW’s in the event
                            that the other party is in material breach of this Agreement, and/or any Order Form or SOW,
                            which has not been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice of such
                            breach.

                            3.3 Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (i) in the event of termination due
                            solely to a breach by MyInfluencersSoftware, then MyInfluencersSoftware shall refund any
                            prepaid fees for Services that would have been rendered after the date of termination; (ii)
                            in the event of termination due solely to a breach by Customer, then Customer shall pay all
                            fees through the date of termination, plus all fees through the remainder of the term of the
                            applicable Order Form and/or SOW; (iii) all rights to use the Platform immediately cease and
                            provision of Professional Services immediately ends; (iv) within thirty (30) days, each
                            party will return or destroy at the disclosing party’s request the other party’s
                            Confidential Information; and (v) Sections 2 and 6 - 11 shall survive, as well as any other
                            provisions which by their terms or sense are intended to survive.

                            3.4 Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination MyInfluencersSoftware
                            will, upon Customer’s request, extract all available Customer Content from the Platform.
                            Both parties will agree to an acceptable transfer methodology, (typically
                            MyInfluencersSoftware provides an SFTP for the transfer). If Customer accounts are
                            deactivated prior to the termination date, data contained within those accounts is not
                            available anymore, therefore Customer must extract the data prior to deactivating accounts.
                            After such thirty (30) day period, MyInfluencersSoftware shall have no obligation to
                            maintain or return any Customer Content. Any reasonable expenses incurred by
                            MyInfluencersSoftware as a result of this extraction shall be the responsibility of
                            Customer.

                            4. FEES AND PAYMENT
                            4.1 Customer shall pay MyInfluencersSoftware all fees set forth in each applicable Order
                            Form and/or SOW (collectively, “Fees”) within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, unless
                            stated otherwise in an applicable Order Form and/or SOW. Customer may withhold payment of
                            any Fees that are the subject of a good faith dispute of which Customer has provided
                            MyInfluencersSoftware written notice within five (5) business days of invoice receipt
                            (“Disputed Fees”); provided that all Fees which are not Disputed Fees shall be timely paid,
                            and the Disputed Fees shall be paid within ten (10) days of resolution of the dispute.

                            4.2 All Fees set forth in an Order Form are payable in advance and are non-cancelable,
                            non-refundable and are based on the MyInfluencersSoftware Services purchased and not based
                            on usage, unless stated otherwise in an applicable Order Form and/or SOW. Customer shall
                            reimburse MyInfluencersSoftware for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
                            performing the Professional Services as described in the applicable SOW upon the submission
                            to Customer of applicable receipts or other documentation.

                            4.3 MyInfluencersSoftware reserves the right to charge Customer interest at the rate of the
                            lesser of 1.5% per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law on any Fees not received by
                            MyInfluencersSoftware within fifteen (15) days of the payment due date. Additionally, in the
                            event any Fees or expenses are more than thirty (30) days overdue, MyInfluencersSoftware may
                            (i) suspend its performance of the MyInfluencersSoftware Services, and (ii) require full
                            payment before MyInfluencersSoftware resumes performance.

                            4.4 All Fees exclude taxes and Customer agrees to pay any applicable taxes charged arising
                            from this Agreement in a timely manner, other than those based on MyInfluencersSoftware’s
                            income. If Customer is tax-exempt, Customer shall provide MyInfluencersSoftware with its
                            tax-exemption number and certificate within five (5) business days after the Effective Date.
                            Customer shall be responsible for any liability or expense incurred by MyInfluencersSoftware
                            as a result of Customer’s failure or delay in paying taxes due or if Customer’s claimed tax
                            exemption is rejected. If Customer is legally required to withhold tax from its payment of
                            Fees to MyInfluencersSoftware, and/or to pay any equalization taxes, Customer agrees to
                            gross up all Fees that are subject to such withholding tax, and shall not be entitled to
                            reduce the Fees on an Order Form and/or SOW by any equalization taxes, such that the net
                            payment received by MyInfluencersSoftware is the full originally stated amount of such Fees.

                            5. WARRANTIES
                            5.1 Each party represents and warrants that it has the right and authority to enter into and
                            perform its obligations under this Agreement and shall comply with all applicable laws.

                            5.2 MyInfluencersSoftware warrants that during the Term, when used by Customer as expressly
                            permitted hereunder, the Platform shall substantially conform to the User Guides and shall
                            perform in all material respects in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each
                            Order Form or SOW. In the event Customer determines that the Platform has not met the
                            foregoing warranty, Customer shall give MyInfluencersSoftware prompt notice of the
                            deficiency, including details sufficient to allow MyInfluencersSoftware to replicate the
                            deficiency, and in such event MyInfluencersSoftware will use commercially reasonable efforts
                            to remedy the identified deficiency. If MyInfluencersSoftware does not remedy the
                            deficiency, either party may terminate the affected Order Form or SOW and in such case
                            MyInfluencersSoftware will refund to Customer the amount of any pre-paid Fees for the period
                            after termination as its exclusive remedy. This warranty does not cover any problem with or
                            damage to the Platform to the extent caused by: (i) Customer’s negligence, abuse, misuse,
                            improper handling and/or use, (ii) modifications by anyone other than MyInfluencersSoftware
                            or its Contractors; (iii) failure to operate the Platform in accordance with the User
                            Guides; or (iv) a Force Majeure Event.

                            5.3 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND WARRANTY
                            REMEDIES ARE SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION AND, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
                            THE MyInfluencersSoftware SERVICES, INCLUDING ALL FUNCTIONS THEREOF, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS
                            IS" BASIS, WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS,
                            IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACCURACY OF CONTENT,
                            NON-INFRINGEMENT, NON-INTERFERENCE, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
                            THAT THE MyInfluencersSoftware SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY OR ERROR-FREE.

                            6. INDEMNIFICATION
                            6.1 MyInfluencersSoftware shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer and its
                            Affiliates (the “Customer Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, costs,
                            expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), penalties, judgments,
                            settlement amounts and damages (“Losses”) incurred by a Customer Party arising from a claim,
                            suit, action or proceeding brought by a third party (a “Claim”) against any Customer Party
                            alleging that the MyInfluencersSoftware Services (excluding the Content and use of the
                            Connected Services Authorization) when used by Customer as permitted hereunder infringes any
                            third party intellectual property right. In the event it is held (or in
                            MyInfluencersSoftware’s reasonable opinion it is likely to be held) that the
                            MyInfluencersSoftware Services when used in accordance with this Agreement and the
                            applicable Order Form and/or SOW infringe a third party’s rights, MyInfluencersSoftware
                            shall at its expense either (x) procure for Customer the right to continue using the
                            affected elements of the MyInfluencersSoftware Services, or (y) replace or modify the
                            affected elements of the MyInfluencersSoftware Service, in whole or in part, so that it
                            becomes non-infringing but provides substantially equivalent functionality. If
                            MyInfluencersSoftware, in its sole discretion, determines that neither (x) nor (y) are
                            commercially reasonable, MyInfluencersSoftware may terminate the provision of the affected
                            MyInfluencersSoftware Services and refund to Customer the amount of any pre-paid Fees
                            applicable to the terminated MyInfluencersSoftware Services for the period after
                            termination. Customer acknowledges that its right to obtain indemnification and the rights
                            described in the preceding sentence are its sole and exclusive rights in the event of such a
                            claim.

                            6.2 Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless MyInfluencersSoftware and its
                            Affiliates, (the “MyInfluencersSoftware Parties”) from and against any Losses arising from a
                            breach of the Acceptable Use Policy

                            6.3 The indemnification obligations contained in this Agreement are conditioned upon: (i)
                            notice by the party seeking indemnity (“Indemnitee”) to the party from whom indemnity is
                            sought (“Indemnitor”) of any Claim for which indemnity is claimed within five (5) days of
                            the Indemnitee receiving notice of such claim (failure to meet this condition does not
                            exempt the Indemnitor of its indemnification obligation, except to the extent that failure
                            has materially prejudiced the Indemnitor’s ability to defend the Claim); (ii) complete
                            control of the defense and settlement of the Claim by the Indemnitor, provided that no
                            settlement may be made without the consent of the Indemnitee, such consent not to be
                            unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (iii) reasonable cooperation by the Indemnitee in the
                            defense as the Indemnitor may request. The Indemnitee has the right to participate in the
                            defense against the indemnified Claims with counsel of its choice and at its own expense but
                            may not confess judgment, admit liability or take any other actions prejudicial to the
                            defense. Further, the Indemnitee may not settle an Indemnified claim unless such settlement
                            includes an unconditional release of the other party from all liability on all Claims, or
                            the other party gives its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                            6.4 THIS SECTION STATES EACH PARTY’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER AND EACH PARTY’S SOLE
                            REMEDY FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIM DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.

                            7. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
                            7.1 IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
                            PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT
                            LIMITATION LOSS OF REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OR LOST SALES OR ANY
                            OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE MyInfluencersSoftware SERVICES.

                            7.2 EXCEPT FOR (I) EITHER PARTY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT; (II) THE PARTIES’
                            INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS; AND/OR (III) A BREACH OF SECTION 2.8, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
                            TOTAL LIABILITY OF ONE PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY AND ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES
                            OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE OR
                            OTHERWISE), ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE MyInfluencersSoftware
                            SERVICES, EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE TOTAL FEES RECEIVED BY OR PAYABLE TO
                            MyInfluencersSoftware FROM CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS
                            IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
                            MyInfluencersSoftware HAS SET ITS PRICES AND ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT IN RELIANCE UPON
                            THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND THE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN,
                            AND THAT THE SAME FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE PARTIES
                            AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMERS SPECIFIED IN THIS
                            AGREEMENT WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN
                            NO EVENT SHALL THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO FEES DUE FOR THE
                            MyInfluencersSoftware SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

                            7.3 Neither party will be liable to the other for any failure to perform, or delay in the
                            performance of, any obligation under this Agreement caused by a Force Majeure Event.

                            8. CONFIDENTIALITY
                            8.1 “Confidential Information” means: (i) business or technical information, including
                            product plans, designs, source code, marketing plans, business opportunities, personnel,
                            research, development or know-how (all of the foregoing as they relate to the
                            MyInfluencersSoftware Services, including the Platform (current or planned), are
                            MyInfluencersSoftware’s Confidential Information, and all of the foregoing as they relate to
                            Customer’s business, are Customer’s Confidential Information); and (ii) information
                            designated by the disclosing party as “confidential” or “proprietary” or which, under the
                            circumstances taken as a whole, would reasonably be deemed to be confidential. Confidential
                            Information includes information disclosed prior to or during the Term of this Agreement.
                            Confidential Information shall not include information which: (i) is or becomes generally
                            available to the public other than as a result of wrongful disclosure by the receiving
                            party; (ii) is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from
                            a third party that rightfully possesses the Confidential Information and has the legal right
                            to make such disclosure; or (iii) is developed independently by the receiving party without
                            use of any of disclosing party’s Confidential Information and by persons without access to
                            such Confidential Information.

                            8.2 Customer and MyInfluencersSoftware each agree not to use any Confidential Information of
                            the other party for any purpose other than as necessary to perform its obligations under
                            this Agreement. During and after the Term, neither receiving party will disclose any
                            Confidential Information of the disclosing party to any third party without the prior
                            written consent of the disclosing party, except (i) where such disclosure is necessary for
                            the performance of the receiving party’s obligations under this Agreement; or (ii) as may be
                            required by Laws (provided that the party obligated to make the disclosure shall give the
                            other party advance notice of such requirement to the extent legally permitted). Each
                            receiving party shall be responsible for compliance with this Section and applicable
                            provisions of this Agreement by its employees and Contractors, and shall obtain the
                            agreement by each employee and Contractor to keep the Confidential Information of the
                            disclosing party confidential and to use it solely as required for the performance of the
                            receiving party’s obligations hereunder. For purposes of clarity, Customer may publicly
                            disclose the fact that it is using the MyInfluencersSoftware Services, but all details about
                            the uses, functionalities or other aspects of the MyInfluencersSoftware Services (including
                            screenshots and specific features of the Platform) are Confidential Information of
                            MyInfluencersSoftware and may not be disclosed.

                            9. DATA PROTECTION
                            The parties acknowledge and agree that with regard to the Processing of Personal Data,
                            Customer is the Controller and MyInfluencersSoftware is the Processor as such terms are
                            defined in the Data Processing Addendum. MyInfluencersSoftware’s Data Processing Addendum,
                            in its current version at the Effective Date of this Agreement, is incorporated into and
                            subject to the terms of this Agreement by reference.

                            10. GOVERNING LAW
                            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, without reference to
                            conflict of law principles. The parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of
                            the state or federal courts located in New York County, NY, over any suit, action or
                            proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. THE PARTIES UNCONDITIONALLY AND
                            IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO
                            OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT ANY ORDER FORM AND/OR SOW.

                            11. MISCELLANEOUS
                            11.1 This Agreement incorporates any exhibits, appendices and other documents referred to in
                            it, including, but not limited to, the Acceptable Use Policy, the SLA and/or, if applicable,
                            any data processing agreement. This Agreement together with each Order Form and/or SOW is
                            the entire agreement between the parties relating to this subject matter, and supersedes (i)
                            any pre-printed terms on a purchase order, which shall have no effect, and (ii) all prior or
                            contemporaneous understandings of the parties related thereto, including any separate
                            non-disclosure agreement between the parties relating to this subject matter as it relates
                            to confidential information disclosed after the date of and pursuant to this Agreement. This
                            Agreement, any Order Form and SOW may be amended or any right waived only in writing signed
                            by the parties. By executing this Agreement, Customer affirms and agrees that
                            MyInfluencersSoftware has not made any representations to induce Customer to enter this
                            Agreement except for those representations explicitly set forth in this Agreement or in an
                            Order Form or SOW entered into under this Agreement. Customer disclaims reliance upon any
                            representations if any kind whatsoever except for those set forth in this Agreement or Order
                            Form or SOW.

                            11.2 In no event may either party initiate any action against the other party pursuant to
                            this Agreement more than two (2) years from the date the claim arose, in case such
                            limitation is permitted by applicable law.

                            11.3 Except as may be expressly provided herein, all remedies provided for in this Agreement
                            are non-exclusive remedies.

                            11.4 Either party may assign this Agreement in whole or in part (i) to an Affiliate; (ii) in
                            connection with a merger where the contracting entity does not survive such merger, or (iii)
                            in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the contracting entity’s assets
                            related thereto. Except as expressly stated in this section, neither party may assign its
                            rights or obligations under this Agreement without obtaining the other party’s prior written
                            consent. Any assignment in contravention of this section is void.

                            11.5 MyInfluencersSoftware may identify Customer as a MyInfluencersSoftware Customer in
                            MyInfluencersSoftware’s marketing materials, promotional presentations, customer lists,
                            website and other written and electronic materials (name and logo). Any other uses of either
                            party’s name and logo shall be subject to the prior review and approval of the owning party,
                            such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

                            11.6 MyInfluencersSoftware has the worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to
                            use non-personal aggregated/anonymized statistical data derived from the operation and use
                            of the MyInfluencersSoftware Services (“Statistical Data”) for internal business and/or
                            operating purposes only, provided that MyInfluencersSoftware does not share with any third
                            party Statistical Data which reveals the identity of Customer, Customer Users, or Customer’s
                            Confidential Information except as permitted pursuant to Section 8.

                            11.7 Nothing in this Agreement will create any association, partnership, or joint venture
                            between the parties. No party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, nor is any
                            party relying on, any representation or warranty outside those expressly stated in this
                            Agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement
                            unenforceable, all other provisions will remain in full force and effect and the
                            unenforceable provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that most nearly
                            achieves the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision.

                            11.8 In the event of a conflict between any provision of this Agreement and an SOW or Order
                            Form, the terms of the SOW or Order Form shall prevail with respect to the matters covered
                            by the applicable SOW and/or Order Form.

                            Acceptable Use
                            1. Compliance

                            Customer must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and the terms of service and
                            rules and policies of any Connected Service with respect to (i) its usage of the Platform,
